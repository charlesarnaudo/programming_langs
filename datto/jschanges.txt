I would fix linting errors that came up for the file, which include:
    - Missing semicolons
    - Mixing tabs / spaces
    - Creating a function inside of a loop

I would change:
    - Move the function declaration out of the for loop starting at line 14
    - Check the return value for pushIfDoesntExist() and only update when a
      change has been made
    - Instead of attaching multiple EventListeners to each <li>, attach just
      one listener to the <ul>

** Note **
I had never written js before so attached to this submission is a js file with
the changes listed above made - I figured it would be good practice and it was
a lot of fun
